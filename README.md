# Fair Resource Distribution

Martina Balestra, Ellie Haber, Sheng Wang

We are developing an algorithm whose objective is to model the distribution of a resource across a community in order to maximize equitable access to the resource. Cities are often segregated (for example, by race and income) and therefore distributing public resources and infrastructure in a way that enables equal access for people within various subgroups becomes an important consideration; however, to date, most resource allocation algorithms have optimized for maximum usage and not *most equitable usage* of a resource.  The proposed approach builds on a modified k-means clustering algorithm and takes into consideration the distribution of the underlying demographics in a community for planning where to place a resource.
